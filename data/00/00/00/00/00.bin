  |   We shall make our very own world map! Approve or Disapprove? The      |

  |                                                                         |
  |   It is 15th century Europe, at the height of age of discovery. Back    |
  |   when the very shape of the world was still unclear, and believed to   |
  |   be flat.                                                              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Searching for what lies at the ends of the Earth, collecting          |
  |   information about the world, creating their very own world map -      |
  |   but only the finest Admirals may take off on these adventures. You    |
  |   are a trader who charters a boat to take on the massive venture of    |
  |   creating a world map.                                                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Are you ready to reveal the true shape of the world?                  |
  |                                                                         |
  |   You listen to the reports of Admirals returned from their             |
  |   explorations and use them as a basis for creating a map. The          |
  |   reports from these Admirals range vastly, from the authentic to       |
  |   somewhat dubious tales of monsters. Thus, depending on what you       |
  |   approve or disapprove, the shape of the world can change greatly.     |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Perhaps the continents we know now will not exist, while Atlantis     |
  |   and Mu take their place on the map. The only finished map of the      |
  |   world will be a "subjective world" that reflects your values, and     |
  |   one where only that which is approved by you becomes the truth.       |
